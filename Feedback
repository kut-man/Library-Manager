Aida Almazbekova:
This program is really useful and I already used. I hope That you will continue learning.

Aybek Bekbolov:
I am not programmer therefore my feedback will be simple. I tried this program it is minimalistic and functional.

Nurak Karabekov:
Maybe GUI is not the best one but the program side is much better. He used Database, it adds, updates data. I tried to crush the program but I could not. He used Try/catches.

Kushbek Janasharov:
For second course student I think it is ok. I hope Next time you will try to make more interesting project.

Nuradil Kasymov:
Everything works great, you could customize interface but anyway. Try your best and never give up.
